# Calibrate stations

To ensure the sleigh will stop on the right spot, it needs to be calibrated first.
To ensure the calibration is properly done, a tool will be made to ensure proper alignment between the pourer and the sleigh.

## Steps:

- Install the calibration tool instead of the pourer #1
- Activate the laser on the calibration tool
- Use the calibration mode to move the sleigh.
    - Align the center of the sleigh with the laser pointer

# Calibrate scale

To calibrate the scale you need two proper weights. If you already have an existing scale you can use it to qualify two weights.

## Steps:

- Go into scale calibration mode
- Do a tare without any weight on the scale
- Put the first qualified weight, then enter how much it weight on screen. Save.
- Put the second qualified weight, then enter how much it weight on screen. Save.
- Test de scale to ensure it works correctly.
